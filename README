hai guys, what we need to do is:

do backend crud for the nusantara site with php

korang jgn lupa clone repo dlm htdocs dkt xampp

- get data = basically display data
- update data (put)
- delete data
- post data = form to add data dan juga add data dari collections.json into database

db details ada dlm createdb.php

Lab Assignment (4person/group): warisannusantara
Store the collections.json record (from last week) to the database (same database as above), table collection (you can save image data as link or blob)

Modify the code warisannusantara.html (from last week) to make a get request and display the collection

zip the project and submit to elearning (week10)
